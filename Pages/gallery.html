                    <p>During my first year of university, I had the opportunity to explore the fascinating world of
                        p5.js and create an interactive spiral project that captured the essence of dynamic
                        visualizations. With p5.js's powerful capabilities, I was able to bring my creative vision to
                        life by generating an ever-evolving spiral that responded to user input. By manipulating
                        parameters such as speed, color, and size, the spiral took on various mesmerizing forms,
                        enticing users to interact and uncover its hidden patterns. Through this project, I not only
                        honed my coding skills but also discovered the immense potential of blending art and technology
                        to create immersive visual experiences.</p>

                    <p>I created a composition using Mini-Tidal software, which presented limitations such as a
                        restricted number of synthesizer options and a lack of visual interface. To overcome these, I
                        experimented with different parameters and effects to generate unique sounds, and organized my
                        code meticulously to delineate sections and transitions.</p>

                    <p>Towards the end of my first semester, I embarked on an exciting project that involved creating a
                        vending machine program using the powerful C++ language. I designed an intuitive user interface
                        that replicated the
                        functionalities of a real vending machine. The program managed tasks like displaying
                        product options, receiving user input, processing transactions, and dispensing items
                        accordingly.
                        This vending machine program project became a pivotal milestone during my first year of
                        university, significantly enhancing my proficiency in C++ programming and broadening my
                        problem-solving abilities. It provided me with hands-on experience in designing efficient
                        algorithms, managing user input and ensuring the
                        reliability of software systems..</p>

                    <p>As part of the Digital Storytelling module, I created a short game using the software Bitsy.
                        I encountered a few limitations while working with it. Firstly, the limited visual and
                        audio capabilities restricted the overall aesthetics and immersive experience. To overcome this,
                        I focused on crafting a compelling storyline and designing engaging dialogue to captivate
                        players. Secondly, the rigid grid-based movement system posed a challenge for creating dynamic
                        exploration. I tackled this by carefully planning the level design, strategically placing
                        interactive elements to maintain player engagement. Despite these limitations, I learned to
                        adapt and leverage the strengths of the platform to deliver an enjoyable and meaningful gaming
                        experience.</p>
